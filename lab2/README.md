# Lab 2: Iterative Methods in Trilinos

In this lab we will solve a PDE problem using data structures and solvers from the Trilinos framework.
We will assess the suitability of various solvers and preconditioners for CPU and GPU computing.


## What you will practice here

- compile and run MPI+X code (Modules, CMake, slurm, CPU and GPU nodes)
- creating sparse linear systems with Trilinos
- solving them using preconditioned Krylov methods
- deciding which algorithms are suitable for which platform

## Your tasks

There are three individual exercises on
- [Creating and filling matrices and vectors](exercise-1)
- [Iterative solution of linear systems](exercise-2)
- [Using an advanced Domain-Decomposition preconditioner (FROSch)](exercise-3)
