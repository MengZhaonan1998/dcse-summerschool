# Lab 4: Performance optimization of communication-avoiding algorithms

(introductory text)

## What you will practice here

- calling BLAS/lapack routines
- applying roofline analysis
- selecting orthogonalization strategies for 


## Your tasks

## Ideas for this lab (to be worked out)

- RACE?
- TSQR vs. SVQB + roofline model


Ideas: implement SVQB, measure GEMM performance for tall-skinny matrices,
implement your own Householder-TSQR given some code skeleton
(perhaps task-based to close the loop to the first exercise?)
